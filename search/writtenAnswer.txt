1. 
	(a) The branching factor of the successor function if the Pacman is in the corner is 2, since the Pacman is against the walls in the other two directions
	(b) The branching factor of the successor function if the Pacman is in the middle (assuming no interior walls) is 4, since the Pacman is free to move in all 4 directions
	(c) Maximum possible depth = log2(N*N)

2.
	(a) n = O(4^(ctotal/cmin + 1))
	    This is because ctotal/cmin represent the 
	(b)
